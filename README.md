# Jo's Portfolio

## What I did:
For this assignment, I created three pages of a website for my portfolio: the Home page, the Portfolio page, and the Contact page.  I used different types of files for this project:

* index.html
* portfolio.html
* contact.html
* styles.css
* README.md

The following README explains what I did and where I had trouble.

## What I Had Trouble With:
The things that worked well for me were the navbar, using the bootstrap components, the portfolio page, and the adding in assets.  What I had trouble with the most was the additional css that I needed to get everything to look the way I needed/wanted.  For a long time, I hadn't noticed that the style.css that was linked to my pages was not the styles.css that I was editing.  I lost countless hours because of the linked stylesheet that wasn't making any of my changes.  I also had trouble getting the grid to line up the way I wanted, but that could have been a result of the stylesheet not being spelled correctly.

## Finishing Touches:
After I corrected the stylesheet, I was able to finally style my footer, make my pages responsive, and start properly editing my pages.  I just wish that I had seen that mistake hours earlier.
